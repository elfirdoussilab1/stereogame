Project PAF 2022 - Telecom Paris

The objective was to create a video game that is suited for a 3D TV. Hence, we chose to develop a two-player game that looks like a tennis game, but with bats instead of rackets, and where each player defend his goal.
There is also a mystery box that displays some special effects when we hit it with the ball.

Enjoy ðŸ˜Š !
